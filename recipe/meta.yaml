  summary: 'Version-bump your software with a single command!'

  description: |
    A small command line tool to simplify releasing software by updating all
    version strings in your source code by the correct increment. Also creates
    commits and tags:

    * version formats are highly configurable
    * works without any VCS, but happily reads tag information from and writes
      commits and tags to Git and Mercurial if available
    * just handles text files, so it's not specific to any programming language
    * supports Python2, Python3 and Pypy
